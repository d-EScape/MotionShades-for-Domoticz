# MotionShades-for-Domoticz
Connect Motion rolling shades to Domoticz using the Motion WiFi-bridge

Tested with the "Motion" rolling shades by Coulisse, but might work with other types of blinds and curtains that use the same Wifi - 433MHz bridge.

Requires https://github.com/starkillerOG/motion-blinds. Thanks to @starkillerOG for providing the python module!
